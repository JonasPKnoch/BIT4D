#BIT4D
BIT4D (Back In The 4th Dimension), is a little 4-dimensional rendering engine built in Godot. Using the slicing method, it renders 4D geometry by calculating its 3-dimensional intersection with the view plane.

The rendering is done efficiently on the GPU. The 4D models are loaded from a custom file format that can be converted from 4D OFF.
